Postmortem:

I worked on this for three days.

Friday:
After not being able to do this on Thursday due to dialysis, I spent the entire day trying to 
get my program to run on code released during lecture 8. I changed names, and separated values, 
but ultimately failed to get my program to run because I couldn't figure out how to add to
my data[2] structure.

Saturday:
After getting permission from the professor to view other lectures, I used code from lecture 9
and struggled to remember how to access the data from the separate Data Class. An hour later, I
remebered what I learned from lecture 8 and wrote all of the functions I needed fairly quickly.
I wasn't able to start my day coding until about 6 pm, so I had to cut my time short.

Sunday:
I wrote part 6 and the comments on this day. part 6 was challenging, but only because I did not 
want to use information from lecture 10. I, after taking a break, eventually figured out that I
couldn't just skip ahead in the dictionary. I thought of a way to hold old information and using
three entires of the dictionary to solve part 6. I now submit my assignment after spending at 
least 18 hours on it.
